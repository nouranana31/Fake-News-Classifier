# Fake-News-Classifier

Fake News Prediction using Machine Learning with Python

# Description

A classification problem in which I used different machine learning algorithms to predict if the news is fake or real, compared the accuracy of the models and saved the one with highest accuracy.

# Algorithms-Used

1- Logistic Regression    
2- Decision Tree   
3- Random Forest   
4- K-Nearest Neighbor   
5- Support Vector Machines(highest accuracy)   

# About-the-Dataset

1- id: unique id for a news article   
2- title: the title of a news article   
3- author: author of the news article   
4- text: the text of the article; could be incomplete   
5- label: a label that marks whether the news article is real or fake:   
                                                                       1: Fake news   
                                                                       0: real News

# Usage

The Internet is one of the important inventions and a large number of persons are its users. These
persons use this for different purposes. There are different social media platforms that are
accessible to these users. Any user can make a post or spread the news through these online
platforms. These platforms do not verify the users or their posts. So some of the users try to spread
fake news through these platforms. These fake news can be a propaganda against an individual,
society, organization or political party. A human being is unable to detect all these fake news. So
there is a need for machine learning classifiers that can detect these fake news automatically.
